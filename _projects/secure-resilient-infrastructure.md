title: Security Engineering for Resilient Networked Critical Infrastructure
layout: default
description: The Security Engineering project integrates education and research that may result in practical security and resilience for the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) that comprise network-connected critical infrastructure.

Embedded and cyber-physical systems are increasingly vulnerable to attack especially because of ubiquitous network access—the Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the proliferation of such systems. Device heterogeneity and emerging communication protocols make it difficult to understand the scope of an IoT application’s attack surface, much less secure it. This project explores the security of IoT devices through an IoT Security Testbed that will enable further research exploration in the area of IoT Security and resilience.
