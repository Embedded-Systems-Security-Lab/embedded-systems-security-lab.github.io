title: Security Engineering for Resilient Networked Critical Infrastructure
layout: default
description: The Security Engineering project integrates education and research that may result in practical security and resilience for the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) that comprise network-connected critical infrastructure.

Embedded and cyber-physical systems are increasingly vulnerable to attack especially because of ubiquitous network access—the Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the proliferation of such systems . Device heterogeneity and emerging communication protocols make it difficult to understand the scope of an IoT application’s attack surface, much less secure it. We are planning to construct an IoT research testbed that consists of a gateway router to the Internet, an externally-accessible server for remote access and administration, internal servers that can simulate Cloud platforms and physical environments, and a suite of IoT applications. This testbed will enable further research exploration in the area of IoT security and resilience. 

The goals of the project are:
1. Increase the number of majors and graduation rates of undergraduate students pursuing careers or graduate school in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) related area in the computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering degree programs at Howard University; 
2. Increase the number of enrollments and graduation rates of graduate students pursuing DHS related careers in cybersecurity at Howard University; 
3. Increase student understanding of resilience and security problems and solutions in networked systems; 
4. Establish a new Ph.D. specialization in Resilient Critical Infrastructure; 
5. Increase the number of students placed in Ph.D. programs associated with the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) Center of Excellence (CoE) at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana; 
6. Increase the number of joint publications and grants between Early Career Faculty at Howard University and other members of the CIRI CoE.
