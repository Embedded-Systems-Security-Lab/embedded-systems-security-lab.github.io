The Embedded Systems Security Lab (ESSL) is a research and instructional lab that focuses on solving problems that arise from the inter-depencies between safety and security within complex, networked cyber-physical systems (CPS). Under the direction of [Dr. Gedare Bloom](https://gedare.github.io), the ESSL group focuses on the challenges inherent in balancing CPS real-time constraints with security obligations imposed by network connectivity and cognizant of performance requirements needed for production systems.
